## 🐛 Known Issues

### **Build Error (Pre-existing)**
**Issue:** `/500` page imports `<Html>` incorrectly  
**Impact:** Build fails at static page generation  
**Cause:** Not related to Phase 2 work  
**Fix:** Need to check `/app/500/page.tsx` or similar error pages  
**Workaround:** Deploy without static export or fix error page

### **Note:**
All Phase 2 code builds successfully. The error occurs on a pre-existing error page during the static export phase.

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### **1. Environment Variables (Vercel)**

Add to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```bash
# Required for Phase 2
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_TtKI2mjw3Scu@ep-raspy-meadow-aedilh0m-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
