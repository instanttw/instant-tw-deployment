## UI / UX Suggestions & Precise Components

* Use **Card Layouts** on Overview page for key metrics — large number + small sparkline (trend).
* Use **Tables with sortable columns** for lists (users, sites, products).
* Use color-coded **status badges** (active / expired / warning / error) for clarity.
* Use **modals** or side panels for quick edits (renew, edit plan) so admin need not leave the page.
* Have **bulk action support** (e.g. select several licenses → revoke, update, send email).
* Use **breadcrumbs / side navigation** for structure.
* Responsive design so dashboard works on tablets / mobiles.
* Search + global filter (date range, product, user) always visible.
* Role-based appearance: hide sections not relevant to user’s role.
