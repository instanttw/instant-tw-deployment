## Root Cause Analysis

### Why These Mismatches Occurred:

1. **Hardcoded Prices on Pages**
   - Service pages had prices directly in the component code
   - Database had different prices from the seeder
   - No validation between page display and database

2. **No Single Source of Truth**
   - Prices defined in multiple places:
     - Service page components
     - Database seeder
     - No centralized pricing config

3. **Stripe Uses Database Prices**
   - Stripe checkout API queries database for prices
   - If page shows $199 but database has $99, Stripe shows $99
   - User confusion: "I clicked $199 but seeing $99!"

## Stripe Checkout Flow (Now Fixed)

### Before Fix:
```
1. User visits /services/seo
2. Sees "Pro: $199/month"
3. Clicks "Get Started"
4. UnifiedCheckoutButton calls /api/checkout/dynamic
5. API queries database: "SELECT price FROM pricing_tiers WHERE tier_name='pro-monthly' AND product_id='seo'"
6. Database returns: 9900 cents ($99)
7. API creates Stripe session with $99
8. User sees Stripe checkout: "$99/month" ❌
9. User confused: "I clicked $199, why am I seeing $99?"
```

### After Fix:
```
1. User visits /services/seo
2. Sees "Pro: $99/month" ✅
3. Clicks "Get Started"
4. UnifiedCheckoutButton calls /api/checkout/dynamic
5. API queries database: "SELECT price FROM pricing_tiers WHERE tier_name='pro-monthly' AND product_id='seo'"
6. Database returns: 9900 cents ($99)
7. API creates Stripe session with $99
8. User sees Stripe checkout: "$99/month" ✅
9. User happy: Price matches expectation!
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/services/security/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Line 21: `monthlyPrice: 69` → `monthlyPrice: 99`
- Line 22: `yearlyPrice: Math.round(69 * 12 * 0.75)` → `Math.round(99 * 12 * 0.75)`
- Line 42: `monthlyPrice: 189` → `monthlyPrice: 299`
- Line 43: `yearlyPrice: Math.round(189 * 12 * 0.75)` → `Math.round(299 * 12 * 0.75)`
- Line 66: `monthlyPrice: 599` → `monthlyPrice: 999`
- Line 67: `yearlyPrice: Math.round(599 * 12 * 0.75)` → `Math.round(999 * 12 * 0.75)`

**Result:** All prices now match database

### 2. `app/services/seo/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Line 21: `monthlyPrice: 199` → `monthlyPrice: 99`
- Line 22: `yearlyPrice: Math.round(199 * 12 * 0.75)` → `Math.round(99 * 12 * 0.75)`

**Result:** Pro tier now matches database ($99/month)

### 3. `app/wp-scan/plans/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Line 45: `price: { monthly: 19, yearly: 190 }` → `price: { monthly: 49, yearly: 441 }`
- Line 67: `price: { monthly: 99, yearly: 990 }` → `price: { monthly: 149, yearly: 1341 }`
- Line 89: `price: { monthly: 299, yearly: 2990 }` → `price: { monthly: 499, yearly: 4491 }`

**Result:** All WP Scan tiers now match database

## Checkout Button Configuration

All service pages use the **UnifiedCheckoutButton** with the correct format:

```tsx
<UnifiedCheckoutButton
  productSlug="security"  // or "seo", "wp-scan"
  tierName={`${plan.productId.replace('security-', '')}-${billingCycle}`}
  // Examples: "pro-monthly", "agency-yearly"
  variant={plan.highlighted ? "default" : "outline"}
  className="w-full"
>
  Get Started
</UnifiedCheckoutButton>
```

### How It Works:
1. Button passes `productSlug` and `tierName` to checkout API
2. API constructs tier name: e.g., `"pro-monthly"` or `"agency-yearly"`
3. API queries database:
   ```sql
   SELECT price, billing_interval 
   FROM pricing_tiers 
   WHERE product_id = 'security' 
   AND tier_name = 'pro-monthly'
   ```
4. API gets price in cents: `9900`
5. API creates Stripe checkout session:
   ```javascript
   unit_amount: 9900,  // $99.00
   recurring: { interval: 'month' }
   ```
6. User redirected to Stripe with correct price ✅

## Prevention for Future

To prevent these mismatches in the future:

### 1. Create Centralized Pricing Config
Create `config/services-pricing.ts`:
```typescript
export const servicesPricing = {
  security: {
    pro: { monthly: 99, yearly: 891 },
    agency: { monthly: 299, yearly: 2691 },
    enterprise: { monthly: 999, yearly: 8991 }
  },
  seo: {
    pro: { monthly: 99, yearly: 891 },
    agency: { monthly: 499, yearly: 4491 },
    enterprise: { monthly: 999, yearly: 8991 }
  },
  'wp-scan': {
    pro: { monthly: 49, yearly: 441 },
    agency: { monthly: 149, yearly: 1341 },
    enterprise: { monthly: 499, yearly: 4491 }
  }
};
```

### 2. Update Pages to Use Config
Instead of:
```typescript
const pricingPlans = [
  {
    name: "Pro",
    monthlyPrice: 99,  // Hardcoded ❌
  }
];
```

Use:
```typescript
import { servicesPricing } from '@/config/services-pricing';

const pricingPlans = [
  {
    name: "Pro",
    monthlyPrice: servicesPricing.security.pro.monthly,  // From config ✅
  }
];
```

### 3. Add Validation Script
Create `scripts/validate-pricing.ts`:
```typescript
// Compare page prices with database prices
// Alert if mismatches found
```

## Related Issues

### WP Scan 404 Errors:
The 404 errors were caused by the pricing tier names not matching database. After fixing pricing, the tier names should work correctly:
- `tierName="pro-monthly"` → Queries database for `tier_name='pro-monthly'` ✅
- `tierName="agency-yearly"` → Queries database for `tier_name='agency-yearly'` ✅

If 404 still occurs, check:
1. Database has the product with slug `'wp-scan'`
2. Database has tiers: `'pro-monthly'`, `'pro-yearly'`, `'agency-monthly'`, `'agency-yearly'`
3. UnifiedCheckoutButton is passing correct `productSlug` and `tierName`
