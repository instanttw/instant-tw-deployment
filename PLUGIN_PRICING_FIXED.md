# ✅ Plugin Pricing Toggle Removed

## What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** All 12 plugin pages showed a monthly/yearly toggle, but plugins only have annual pricing in the database. The toggle was confusing and didn't actually change anything.

**Solution:** Removed the toggle. Plugins now clearly show they are annual licenses only.

---

## Changes Made:

**File:** `app/plugins/[slug]/plugin-detail-client.tsx`

1. ✅ Removed billing cycle state (`billingCycle`)
2. ✅ Removed toggle buttons (Annual/Monthly)
3. ✅ Added clear message: "All plugin licenses are annual with lifetime updates and support"

---

## What Users See Now:

**Before (Confusing):**
```
Choose Your Plan
[Annual (Save 20%)] [Monthly]  ← Toggle that didn't work
```

**After (Clear):**
```
Choose Your Plan
All plugin licenses are annual with lifetime updates and support

[Pricing cards showing annual prices]
```
