## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **Problem Solved**
The original search modal had hardcoded, limited content and was missing:
- All 12 plugins with their full details
- Service pages with comprehensive descriptions
- Partial word matching (e.g., "auth" wouldn't find "authentication")
- Relevance ranking for search results
- Searchable keywords and metadata

### **Solution Delivered**
Created a comprehensive, intelligent search system that:
1. **Indexes ALL content** - 12 plugins, 7 services, 25+ pages
2. **Supports partial matching** - "image" finds "Instant Image Optimizer"
3. **Ranks by relevance** - Best matches appear first
4. **Searches multiple fields** - titles, descriptions, keywords, categories
5. **Shows up to 12 results** - Increased from 8 for better coverage
