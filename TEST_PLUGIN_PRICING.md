## What Was Fixed:

âœ… **Dynamic Pricing** - Different prices for monthly vs yearly
âœ… **Savings Display** - Shows how much you save on yearly
âœ… **Correct Tier Passed** - Button sends `pro-monthly` or `pro-yearly` to API
âœ… **Database Updated** - All 12 plugins now have 6 tiers each (72 total)

## Pricing Formula Applied:

```
Monthly Price = $X
Yearly Price = $X Ã— 12 Ã— 0.75 (25% discount)
Savings = $X Ã— 12 Ã— 0.25
```

**Example (Pro Tier at $39/month):**
- Monthly: $39/month
- Yearly: $39 Ã— 12 Ã— 0.75 = $351/year
- Savings: $117 (25% off $468)

---

## If Pricing Looks Wrong:

**Check in Neon SQL Editor:**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.slug,
  pt.tier_name,
  pt.price / 100.0 as price_dollars,
  pt.billing_interval
FROM products p
JOIN pricing_tiers pt ON p.id = pt.product_id
WHERE p.slug = 'instant-image-optimizer'
  AND pt.tier_name LIKE '%pro%'
ORDER BY pt.tier_name;
```

**Expected Output:**
- pro-monthly: $39.00 (month)
- pro-yearly: $351.00 (year)
