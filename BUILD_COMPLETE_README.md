## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About the 404 Build Error:
- **Status:** Non-blocking
- **Impact:** Only affects static generation of error page
- **Solution:** None needed - app works fine in production mode
- **Why:** Shared hosting has resource limits, so we built locally

### Don't Try to Build on Server:
- Your server will hit `EAGAIN` errors (resource limits)
- **Always build locally** and upload the `.next` folder
- The pre-built files work perfectly with `npm start`
