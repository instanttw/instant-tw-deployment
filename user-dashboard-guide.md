## Guiding Principles

Before diving into sections, here are a few principles to follow for the effective user dashboard:

* **Value-first**: Show high-impact, contextual info that demonstrates value immediately (e.g. “you saved X time”, “your plugin is optimizing Y images”) ([ProductLed][1])
* **Clarity & simplicity**: Avoid clutter. Use progressive disclosure: show summary + key actions up front, allow drill-downs for details.
* **Goal-driven navigation**: Design the UI so users are guided toward meaningful actions (renew, upgrade, configure, etc.) ([ProductLed][1])
* **Responsive / mobile-friendly**: Many users may access from mobile or tablets.
* **Permissions & role-awareness**: If users have multiple sites or seats, show what is relevant to the logged-in user only.

## Recommended Sections & Features

Here’s a breakdown of what the User Dashboard should comprise (core modules). You can adapt or remove some depending on the user plan / product:

| Section                             | Purpose / What to Show                                                                | Key Features / Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Example User Journey Flow through the Dashboard

1. **Login / Landing (Dashboard summary)**

   * The user is greeted with a summary: “Your plugin is active on 3 sites. You have 10,234 images optimized so far. Your license expires in 30 days.”
   * A prominent “Renew now” button.

2. **Drill down to “Sites / Activations”**

   * The user sees the list of sites, each site’s plugin version, status (healthy / needing update).
   * For one site flagged with outdated plugin, user clicks “Update plugin” or “Check issues”.

3. **Go to “Usage & Analytics”**

   * The user sees charts: optimizations per day over last 30 days; % performance improvement; possible anomalies.
   * The user can export.

4. **Manage license**

   * User sees their license details; chooses to renew or upgrade; views invoices.

5. **Support**

   * They open a new support ticket, or check status of their existing ones; access relevant doc for their plugin.

6. **Settings**

   * They update their notification preferences, personal info, or API keys.

## Things to Be Precise / Implementation Considerations

* **Lazy loading & pagination**: For sections with many entries (activations, logs), use pagination / infinite scroll to keep performance good.
* **Drill-down & context preservation**: When a user clicks into a site or log, allow them to navigate back smoothly.
* **Role-based views**: If some users have multiple sites / seats or multiple user levels under an organization, show only relevant data per user.
* **Data caching / freshness**: Some metrics may require polling or periodic updates; show “last updated” timestamps.
* **Error states & fallback**: If data can’t be fetched (site offline, plugin disconnected), show meaningful error and guidance (“reconnect plugin”, “check API”).
* **Security**: Ensure actions (such as revoking license on a site, or making configuration changes) require confirmation, proper rate-limits, and permission checking.
* **Responsive UI & mobile layout**: Prioritize what cards / information show on narrower screens.
* **Localization / i18n**: If you have users in multiple languages or locales.
