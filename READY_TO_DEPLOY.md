## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

```
C:\Users\PIETER\Downloads\instant-tw-deployment\CURRENCY_TEST.html
```

1. Double-click to open in browser
2. Click EUR button
3. Verify all prices show € symbol
4. Reload page
5. Verify € persists (no flash of $)

**✅ If test passes**: Currency logic is working!

### Step 2: Upload to Server

**Files to upload:**
```
C:\Users\PIETER\Downloads\instant-tw-deployment\out\*
```

**Upload everything inside `out` folder:**
- All HTML files
- `_next` folder (complete)
- All other assets

**Important:**
- ⚠️ Don't upload just some files - upload EVERYTHING
- ⚠️ Maintain the exact folder structure
- ⚠️ Include all files in `_next/static/chunks/`

### Step 3: Clear Cache & Test

**Clear Server Cache:**
- Cloudflare cache (if using)
- Server-side cache (nginx, Apache)
- WordPress cache (if applicable)

**Clear Browser Cache:**
- Method 1: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Problem: Currency button still shows $ icon

**Symptom:** Button shows [💵] instead of $  
**Cause:** Old JavaScript cached  
**Fix:** Hard refresh `Ctrl + Shift + R` or clear cache

### Problem: Prices don't update

**Symptom:** Click EUR but prices stay $  
**Cause:** Missing files or cache  
**Fix:** 
1. Re-upload entire `_next` folder
2. Clear browser cache
3. Test in incognito mode

### Problem: Currency resets to USD

**Symptom:** Select EUR, reload page, back to USD  
**Cause:** Script not loading  
**Fix:**
1. Verify `currency-init` script in HTML
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Re-upload all HTML files

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **On Page Load:**
   - `beforeInteractive` script runs immediately
   - Reads currency from localStorage
   - Sets `data-currency` attribute on `<html>`
   - React initializes with saved currency (no flash!)

2. **On Currency Change:**
   - User clicks dropdown → selects currency
   - Updates localStorage
   - Updates React state
   - All components re-render with new symbol
   - Instant update (no page reload)

3. **On Page Reload:**
   - Script reads saved currency
   - Sets attribute before React loads
   - React reads attribute during initialization
   - Correct currency from first pixel!
