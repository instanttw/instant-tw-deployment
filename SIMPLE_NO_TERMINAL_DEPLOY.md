### **STEP 2: Upload to VPS**

**You need to upload these folders:**

Upload to your VPS (via FTP or File Manager):

**Essential Files/Folders to Upload:**

📁 .next/               ← THE MOST IMPORTANT (your built app)
📁 public/              ← Static files
📁 node_modules/        ← Dependencies (large, may take time)
📄 package.json
📄 package-lock.json
📄 .env
📄 next.config.ts
```

**Where to upload:**
- DirectAdmin: `/domains/instant.tw/public_html/app/`
- Or create folder: `/domains/instant.tw/nodejs-app/`

---

### **STEP 3: Setup in DirectAdmin**

1. **Login to DirectAdmin**
2. **Find "Node.js Selector"** or **"Application Manager"**
3. **Create New App:**
   - Domain: `instant.tw`
   - Node Version: `18.x` or `20.x`
   - App Root: `/domains/instant.tw/nodejs-app`
   - Startup: `npm start`
4. **Click "Create"**
5. **Click "Start"**

---

### **STEP 4: Enable SSL**

1. In DirectAdmin: **"SSL Certificates"**
2. Select: **"Let's Encrypt"**
3. Domain: `instant.tw`
4. Click: **"Generate"**

## 🎁 EASIER OPTION: Pre-Built ZIP Package

**Want me to create a ready-to-upload ZIP file?**

I can create a package with:
- Everything built and optimized
- Just upload and extract
- No local building needed
- Includes instructions

**Just say "yes" and I'll create it!**

---

## 🔄 What If DirectAdmin Doesn't Have Node.js?

**Option 1: Contact Your Host**
Ask: "Can you enable Node.js for my domain instant.tw?"

**Option 2: Alternative Deployment**
Some hosts don't support Node.js directly. In that case:
- We'd need to use a different hosting solution
- Or deploy to Vercel (FREE and easy)
- Or use a VPS with Plesk/cPanel that supports Node.js

---

## 📞 Need Help?

**Tell me:**
1. What control panel you have access to? (DirectAdmin, cPanel, Plesk?)
2. Can you see "Node.js" option anywhere?
3. Do you want me to create a pre-built ZIP package?

I'll help you get it deployed! 🚀

---

## ✅ Quick Summary

**With Terminal:** Upload → Configure → Start  
**Without Terminal:** Build locally → Upload everything → Start in control panel

**Both work! The second way just requires uploading more files (including node_modules).**
