## How Stripe Checkout Works (After Fixes)

### For All Services:

1. **User visits service page** (e.g., `/services/seo`)
2. **Sees correct price** (e.g., Enterprise $1,499/month)
3. **Clicks "Get Started"**
4. **UnifiedCheckoutButton triggers:**
   ```typescript
   <UnifiedCheckoutButton
     productSlug="seo"
     tierName="enterprise-monthly"
   >
     Get Started
   </UnifiedCheckoutButton>
   ```
5. **API endpoint called:** `/api/checkout/dynamic`
6. **API queries database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE slug = 'seo';
   SELECT * FROM pricing_tiers 
   WHERE product_id = [seo-id] 
   AND tier_name = 'enterprise-monthly';
   ```
7. **API gets price:** 149900 cents ($1,499)
8. **API creates Stripe session:**
   ```javascript
   {
     unit_amount: 149900,
     currency: 'usd',
     recurring: { interval: 'month' }
   }
   ```
9. **User redirected to Stripe** with valid session ID
10. **Stripe shows:** $1,499.00 per month ✅
11. **User happy:** Price matches what they clicked!

## Root Causes Analysis

### Why These Mismatches Occurred:

1. **Hardcoded Prices**
   - Service pages had prices directly in component code
   - No connection to database or centralized config
   - Easy to get out of sync

2. **No Single Source of Truth**
   - Prices defined in 3 places:
     - Service page components (TypeScript)
     - Database seeder (TypeScript)
     - Database itself (PostgreSQL)
   - No validation between them

3. **Manual Updates**
   - Prices updated manually in multiple files
   - Easy to forget one location
   - No automated sync

4. **Stripe Always Uses Database**
   - Stripe checkout API queries database for prices
   - If page shows $999 but database has $1,499
   - Stripe will always show $1,499 (database wins)
   - User sees price mismatch

## Database Verification

Run these SQL queries to verify all prices are correct:

```sql
-- Security Services
SELECT tier_name, price / 100.0 as price_dollars, billing_interval 
FROM pricing_tiers 
WHERE product_id = (SELECT id FROM products WHERE slug = 'security')
ORDER BY price;

-- Expected:
-- pro-monthly:        $99
-- pro-yearly:         $891
-- agency-monthly:     $299
-- agency-yearly:      $2,691
-- enterprise-monthly: $999
-- enterprise-yearly:  $8,991

-- SEO Services
SELECT tier_name, price / 100.0 as price_dollars, billing_interval 
FROM pricing_tiers 
WHERE product_id = (SELECT id FROM products WHERE slug = 'seo')
ORDER BY price;

-- Expected:
-- pro-monthly:        $99
-- pro-yearly:         $891
-- agency-monthly:     $499
-- agency-yearly:      $4,491
-- enterprise-monthly: $1,499 ✅
-- enterprise-yearly:  $13,491 ✅

-- WP Scan
SELECT tier_name, price / 100.0 as price_dollars, billing_interval 
FROM pricing_tiers 
WHERE product_id = (SELECT id FROM products WHERE slug = 'wp-scan')
ORDER BY price;

-- Expected:
-- pro-monthly:        $49 ✅
-- pro-yearly:         $441 ✅
-- agency-monthly:     $149 ✅
-- agency-yearly:      $1,341 ✅
-- enterprise-monthly: $499 ✅
-- enterprise-yearly:  $4,491 ✅
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Centralized Pricing Config (Recommended)

**Create:** `config/all-service-pricing.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Single source of truth for all service pricing
 * Update here, then re-seed database
 */
export const servicePricing = {
  security: {
    pro: { monthly: 99, yearly: 891 },
    agency: { monthly: 299, yearly: 2691 },
    enterprise: { monthly: 999, yearly: 8991 }
  },
  seo: {
    pro: { monthly: 99, yearly: 891 },
    agency: { monthly: 499, yearly: 4491 },
    enterprise: { monthly: 1499, yearly: 13491 }
  },
  'wp-scan': {
    pro: { monthly: 49, yearly: 441 },
    agency: { monthly: 149, yearly: 1341 },
    enterprise: { monthly: 499, yearly: 4491 }
  }
} as const;

// Type safety
export type ServiceSlug = keyof typeof servicePricing;
export type TierName = 'pro' | 'agency' | 'enterprise';
export type BillingCycle = 'monthly' | 'yearly';
```

### 2. Update Pages to Import Config

**In service pages:**
```typescript
import { servicePricing } from '@/config/all-service-pricing';

const pricingPlans = [
  {
    name: "Pro",
    monthlyPrice: servicePricing.seo.pro.monthly,  // From config
    yearlyPrice: servicePricing.seo.pro.yearly,
  },
  {
    name: "Agency",
    monthlyPrice: servicePricing.seo.agency.monthly,
    yearlyPrice: servicePricing.seo.agency.yearly,
  },
  {
    name: "Enterprise",
    monthlyPrice: servicePricing.seo.enterprise.monthly,
    yearlyPrice: servicePricing.seo.enterprise.yearly,
  }
];
```

### 3. Update Database Seeder to Use Config

**In `scripts/seed-all-products.ts`:**
```typescript
import { servicePricing } from '../config/all-service-pricing';

// SEO Services
{
  slug: 'seo',
  tiers: [
    {
      tier_name: 'pro-monthly',
      price: servicePricing.seo.pro.monthly * 100,  // Convert to cents
      // ...
    },
    {
      tier_name: 'enterprise-monthly',
      price: servicePricing.seo.enterprise.monthly * 100,  // From config
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Add Validation Script

**Create:** `scripts/validate-pricing-sync.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Validates that page prices match database prices
 * Run before deployment to catch mismatches
 */
import { servicePricing } from '../config/all-service-pricing';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';

async function validatePricing() {
  const services = ['security', 'seo', 'wp-scan'];
  const tiers = ['pro', 'agency', 'enterprise'];
  const cycles = ['monthly', 'yearly'];
  
  let mismatches = [];
  
  for (const service of services) {
    for (const tier of tiers) {
      for (const cycle of cycles) {
        // Get from config
        const configPrice = servicePricing[service][tier][cycle];
        
        // Get from database
        const dbResult = await sql`
          SELECT price FROM pricing_tiers 
          WHERE product_id = (SELECT id FROM products WHERE slug = ${service})
          AND tier_name = ${tier + '-' + cycle}
        `;
        const dbPrice = dbResult.rows[0]?.price / 100;
        
        // Compare
        if (configPrice !== dbPrice) {
          mismatches.push({
            service,
            tier,
            cycle,
            config: configPrice,
            database: dbPrice
          });
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  if (mismatches.length > 0) {
    console.error('❌ Pricing mismatches found:');
    console.table(mismatches);
    process.exit(1);
  } else {
    console.log('✅ All prices match between config and database');
  }
}

validatePricing();
```

**Run before deployment:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/validate-pricing-sync.ts
```
