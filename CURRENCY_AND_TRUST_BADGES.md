## 2. Functional Currency Switcher âœ…

### Currency Support
The website now supports 3 currencies with automatic price conversion:
- **USD ($)** - US Dollar (default)
- **EUR (â‚¬)** - Euro
- **GBP (Â£)** - British Pound

### Conversion Rate
As requested: **1 USD = 1 EUR = 1 GBP**
- Prices remain the same
- Only the currency symbol changes

### How It Works

1. **User Selection**
   - Click currency dropdown in header (next to language switcher)
   - Select preferred currency
   - Choice is saved in browser localStorage
   - Persists across page reloads

2. **Automatic Updates**
   - All pricing across the website updates instantly
   - Changes apply to:
     - WP Scan pricing (Free, Pro, Agency, Enterprise)
     - Maintenance service pricing
     - Speed Optimization pricing
     - Security Services pricing
     - SEO Services pricing
     - Themes service pricing
     - Hosting service pricing (all 4 tiers)

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Uses React Context API for global state management
   - Currency preference stored in localStorage
   - All service pages use the `useCurrency()` hook
   - Dynamic symbol rendering: `{symbol}{price}`
