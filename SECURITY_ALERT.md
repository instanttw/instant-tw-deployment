### Risk Level: **HIGH**

   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = [new webhook secret]
   ```

3. Verify it works with new keys

## Why This Happened

When you shared the Stripe keys in this conversation, they became visible to:
- Anyone with access to this conversation
- Potentially logged in various systems
- Could be cached or stored

**Always treat API keys like passwords** - never share them publicly.

## How to Safely Share Keys in Future

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Use Vercel's secure environment variables
- ‚úÖ Use secret management tools (Vercel, AWS Secrets Manager)
- ‚úÖ Share via secure channels (1Password, LastPass)
- ‚úÖ Use test keys for development/debugging

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Post keys in chat/messages
- ‚ùå Commit keys to Git repositories
- ‚ùå Share in screenshots
- ‚ùå Email keys in plain text
- ‚ùå Store in plain text files

## Monitoring (After Key Rotation)

### For the next 48 hours:

1. **Monitor Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Check for unauthorized transactions
   - Review recent payments
   - Check for new customers you don't recognize

2. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Look for unusual API activity
   - Monitor error rates

3. **Alert Setup**:
   - Enable Stripe email alerts for all charges
   - Set up Slack/Discord webhooks for transactions

## If You See Unauthorized Activity

1. **Immediately disable keys** in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Contact Stripe support**: https://support.stripe.com
3. **File a dispute** for any unauthorized charges
4. **Review** all recent transactions
5. **Check** your Stripe balance and payouts

## Best Practices Going Forward

### Development:
- Use **test keys** (pk_test_, sk_test_) for development
- Never commit keys to Git (use .env files with .gitignore)
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days)

### Production:
- Use **live keys** only in Vercel environment variables
- Enable Stripe's security features:
  - 2FA on Stripe account
  - IP whitelisting (if possible)
  - Webhook signature verification (already implemented)

### Team Access:
- Use Stripe's team member feature (don't share keys)
- Grant minimum required permissions
- Remove access when team members leave

## Vercel Environment Variable Security

### Good Setup:
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard (secure)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_...
```

### Bad Setup:
```bash
# In .env file committed to Git (exposed)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
```

### Your .env.local File

Check your local `.env.local` file. If it has LIVE keys, remove them:

```bash
# REMOVE live keys from .env.local
# Use test keys for local development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_test_..."
```

**Live keys should ONLY be in Vercel, never in your local files.**
