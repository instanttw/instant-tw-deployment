# 🚀 READY TO DEPLOY NOW!

## ✅ All Errors Fixed

I've fixed BOTH build errors:

1. ✅ **Database connection error** - Fixed with lazy initialization
2. ✅ **Prerender error** - Fixed checkout pages with dynamic export

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed (Just Now)

### Error 1: Database Connection
**File:** `lib/db-products.ts`
- Changed to lazy initialization
- Accepts both DATABASE_URL and POSTGRES_URL
- Only connects at runtime, not build time

### Error 2: Prerender Error  
**Files:** 
- `app/checkout/success/page.tsx` - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` + Suspense
- `app/checkout/cancel/page.tsx` - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
