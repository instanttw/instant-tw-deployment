## ‚è≥ What Still Needs Work

### Service Pages (4 pages) - NOT YET UPDATED

These service pages still need to be updated with UnifiedCheckoutButton:

1. **`app/services/speed-optimization/page.tsx`**
2. **`app/services/seo/page.tsx`**
3. **`app/services/security/page.tsx`**
4. **`app/services/maintenance/page.tsx`**

**How to fix:**
```tsx
// Replace old buttons with:
<UnifiedCheckoutButton
  productSlug="wordpress-speed-optimization"
  tierName="basic" // or "advanced", "premium", etc.
  variant="default"
>
  Book Service
</UnifiedCheckoutButton>
```
