# RSC 404 Errors - Fix Deployed

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Updated `middleware.ts` with 3 key fixes:

#### 1. **Disabled Locale Detection**
```typescript
localeDetection: false  // Was: true
```
**Why**: Automatic locale detection can cause routing conflicts with RSC prefetch requests

#### 2. **Enhanced RSC Detection**
```typescript
// OLD (unreliable):
if (url.searchParams.has("_rsc") || request.headers.get("RSC") === "1")

// NEW (more reliable):
if (search.includes('_rsc=') || request.headers.get('RSC'))
```
**Why**: `search.includes()` is more reliable for catching all RSC param variations

#### 3. **Explicit Next.js Route Skipping**
```typescript
if (
  pathname.startsWith('/_next') ||
  pathname.startsWith('/api') ||
  pathname.includes('.')
) {
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```
**Why**: Ensures middleware doesn't interfere with Next.js internal routes

## 📊 Deployment Status

**Commit**: `9a12016` - fix(middleware): properly handle RSC prefetch requests  
**Deployed to**: https://wp.instant.tw  
**Vercel Build**: https://vercel.com/instants-projects-b4491864/instant-tw-deployment/CFBrWRS5tn51DTed1QMRkAvPXWqA

## ⏰ Testing Timeline

### Wait 2-5 minutes for:
1. ✅ Build to complete
2. ✅ Edge network to propagate (Vercel global CDN)
3. ✅ Browser caches to clear

### Then test these pages:

```bash
# Clear browser cache first!
# Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
# Or use Incognito/Private mode

https://wp.instant.tw/                 # Homepage
https://wp.instant.tw/plugins          # Plugins
https://wp.instant.tw/pricing          # Pricing
https://wp.instant.tw/docs             # Docs
https://wp.instant.tw/wp-scan          # WP Scan
https://wp.instant.tw/services/hosting # Services
```

## 🔍 What to Check

### 1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)

#### Console Tab - Should NOT see:
```
❌ /plugins?_rsc=a0eu7:1  Failed to load resource: 404
❌ /pricing?_rsc=a0eu7:1  Failed to load resource: 404
```

#### Console Tab - SHOULD see:
```
✅ No RSC 404 errors
✅ Pages load normally
```

#### Network Tab:
- Filter by "rsc"
- All RSC requests should be **200 OK** (green)
- No **404 Not Found** (red)

### 2. **Test Navigation**
Click through header links:
- WP Scan → should load instantly
- Plugins → should load instantly
- Services dropdown → all items should work
- Pricing → should load instantly

### 3. **Check Page Load**
- Pages should load WITHOUT showing "404 This page could not be found"
- Content should appear (not blank black screen)

## 🚨 If Still Seeing 404s

### Check 1: Clear ALL Caches
```bash
# Browser
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear site data: DevTools > Application > Storage > Clear site data

# Vercel
- Go to: https://vercel.com/instants-projects-b4491864/instant-tw-deployment
- Click on deployment
- Check "Build Logs" for errors
```

### Check 2: Verify Deployment Completed
```bash
# Check deployment status
https://vercel.com/instants-projects-b4491864/instant-tw-deployment

# Status should be: "Ready" with green checkmark
```

### Check 3: Test Direct Page Access
```bash
# Open these URLs directly (not through navigation)
https://wp.instant.tw/plugins
https://wp.instant.tw/pricing

# Should load page content, not 404 error
```

## 🛠️ Alternative Fix (If Still Not Working)

If RSC 404s persist after 10 minutes, the issue might be deeper. Try:

### Option A: Disable i18n Middleware Temporarily
Edit `middleware.ts`:
```typescript
export default function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Temporarily bypass ALL middleware for testing
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### Option B: Check Next.js Configuration
Ensure `next.config.ts` has:
```typescript
{
  i18n: undefined,  // Should NOT have this for App Router
  trailingSlash: false,  // Should be false
}
```

### Option C: Check Build Output
Look for these in Vercel build logs:
```
✓ Generating static pages (52/52)
✓ Compiled successfully
```

## 📈 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken):
```
User clicks "Plugins" link
→ Next.js sends RSC prefetch: GET /plugins?_rsc=a0eu7
→ Middleware intercepts and tries to add locale prefix
→ Results in 404
→ Navigation fails
→ Page shows: "404 This page could not be found"
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User clicks "Plugins" link
→ Next.js sends RSC prefetch: GET /plugins?_rsc=a0eu7
→ Middleware detects _rsc param and skips processing
→ Request continues to Next.js router
→ Returns page data successfully (200 OK)
→ Navigation succeeds
→ Page loads instantly
```

## 🎯 Technical Details

### What are RSC Prefetch Requests?
- **RSC** = React Server Components
- `?_rsc=` parameter tells Next.js to return serialized component data
- Used for instant client-side navigation
- Should be handled by Next.js, not middleware

### Why Was Middleware Causing 404s?
1. next-intl middleware was intercepting RSC requests
2. Trying to apply locale routing rules
3. Conflicting with Next.js internal routing
4. Resulting in 404 because it couldn't find the prefetch data

### The Fix:
- Skip middleware entirely for RSC requests
- Let Next.js handle its own internal requests
- Middleware only processes normal page navigation

## 📞 If Issues Persist

### Gather this information:
1. **Browser Console Log** (full output)
2. **Network Tab** (filtered by "rsc", show all failed requests)
3. **Vercel Build Logs** (from deployment page)
4. **Direct page access result** (does https://wp.instant.tw/plugins work when accessed directly?)

### Then:
- Check if **any** pages load, or if **all** show 404
- Try accessing: https://wp.instant.tw/api/auth/signin (should show NextAuth page)
- Check if static assets load: https://wp.instant.tw/favicon.ico

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ No RSC 404 errors in console
2. ✅ All navigation works instantly
3. ✅ Pages load without 404 screen
4. ✅ Header links all work
5. ✅ Hover over links shows instant preview

## 🕐 Current Status

**Deployment**: Building (ETA: 2-5 minutes)  
**Next Test**: After build completes, test all pages  
**Expected Result**: All 404s should be resolved
