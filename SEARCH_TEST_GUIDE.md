## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** No results found  
**Solution:** Check spelling, try partial word (e.g., "optim" instead of "optimization")

**Problem:** Wrong results at top  
**Solution:** Be more specific or use exact plugin/service name

**Problem:** Search modal won't open  
**Solution:** Refresh page, check JavaScript console for errors

**Problem:** Keyboard navigation not working  
**Solution:** Click inside modal to focus, then use arrow keys

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Use partial words** - "image" works better than "instant image optimizer"
2. **Try features** - "malware", "cache", "backup" find relevant solutions
3. **Use categories** - "performance", "security", "seo"
4. **Be specific** - "woo" finds WooCommerce plugin faster than "commerce"
5. **Try keywords** - "fast", "secure", "optimize" work well
