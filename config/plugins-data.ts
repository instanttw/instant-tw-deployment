Pro adds AI-powered link intelligence, unlimited scanning, automatic bulk fixing with one-click, smart redirect creation, advanced link types (JavaScript, iFrame, CSS), 1-year link history, SEO tool integrations, and 50+ fix templates. Pro is perfect for businesses needing comprehensive link management and SEO optimization."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the AI link intelligence work?",
        answer: "Our AI analyzes broken link patterns, page content context, and your site structure to suggest optimal replacement URLs. It recommends redirects based on content similarity, detects orphaned content, and proposes contextual fixes. Pro+ plans get real-time AI suggestions as links break, with continuous learning from your site's link patterns."
      },
      {
        question: "Will it slow down my site?",
        answer: "No! Unlike old plugins like Broken Link Checker, Instant Broken Link Fixer uses efficient background scanning that doesn't impact site performance. Scans run during low-traffic periods, use optimized queries, and can be scheduled to avoid peak hours. Enterprise plans get dedicated scanning resources with zero impact."
      },
      {
        question: "Can it automatically fix broken links?",
        answer: "Yes! Pro and above include one-click bulk fixing with automatic redirect creation. The AI suggests replacement URLs, you approve, and it fixes all instances across your site. It also handles URL normalization (www/non-www, http/https), creates 301 redirects for changed URLs, and can replace 404s with Wayback Machine versions."
      },
      {
        question: "What types of links can it detect?",
        answer: "Free detects internal, external, image, and redirect links. Pro adds JavaScript-loaded links, iFrames, CSS background URLs, PDF internal links, video embeds (YouTube, Vimeo), audio files, document downloads, and CDN resources. It also scans widgets, menus, ACF fields, page builders (Elementor, Divi), and custom post types."
      },
      {
        question: "Does it include redirect management?",
        answer: "Yes! Agency and Enterprise plans include advanced redirect management with automatic 301 creation, redirect chain detection and fixing, import/export rules, regex-based redirects, conditional redirects, mobile-specific redirects, and A/B testing. Includes redirect analytics and performance monitoring."
      },
      {
        question: "What are link building tools?",
        answer: "Agency and Enterprise include tools to find broken link building opportunities on competitor sites (pages linking to 404s you can replace), unlinked brand mentions, and internal linking gaps. Includes outreach email templates, automated sequences, response tracking, and a relationship management pipeline."
      },
      {
        question: "Does it work with page builders?",
        answer: "Yes! Pro and above support Elementor, Divi Builder, Beaver Builder, WPBakery, Gutenberg blocks, and custom page builders. It scans all builder content including shortcodes, custom fields, and dynamic content. Links are detected and fixed without breaking builder structures."
      },
      {
        question: "How many sites can I monitor?",
        answer: "Free and Pro support 1 website. Agency supports up to 25 websites with centralized management. Enterprise supports unlimited sites. All plans include unlimited link scanning per site (Free is limited to 1,000 links, Pro+ unlimited)."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I white-label it for clients?",
        answer: "Yes! Agency and Enterprise plans include complete white-label options: remove plugin branding, use custom plugin names and icons, create client-ready admin interfaces, and generate branded PDF reports. Perfect for agencies managing client sites who want to maintain their brand."
      },
      {
        question: "What integrations are included?",
        answer: "Pro includes direct integrations with Yoast SEO, Rank Math, All in One SEO, and major page builders. Agency adds Zapier (5000+ apps), Make.com, Slack, and Discord. Enterprise adds Google Search Console, Ahrefs API, Moz API, and custom REST/SOAP APIs."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer refunds?",
        answer: "Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. If you're not satisfied for any reason, contact us within 30 days of purchase for a full refund, no questions asked."

        question: "What's the difference between Free and Pro versions?",
        answer: "Free includes one-click backups, stores 3 local backups, basic scheduling, and email notifications. Pro adds AI optimization, 25GB cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, OneDrive), incremental backups that save 90% storage, one-click staging, site migration tools, AES-256 encryption, and granular restore options. Pro is perfect for serious businesses."
      },
      {
        question: "How does AI backup optimization work?",
        answer: "Our AI analyzes your file changes and suggests optimal backup schedules. It identifies critical files, predicts storage needs, and automatically adjusts backup frequency. The AI learns your site's patterns to schedule backups during low-traffic periods, reducing server impact while ensuring complete protection."
      },
      {
        question: "What is incremental backup and why is it better?",
        answer: "Incremental backups only save files that changed since the last backup, reducing storage by 90% and speeding up backup times dramatically. Instead of backing up your entire 5GB site daily, we only backup the 50MB that changed. This means faster backups, less server load, and huge storage savings."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I backup to my own cloud storage?",
        answer: "Yes! Pro+ plans support Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Microsoft OneDrive. You can use our included storage (25GB Pro, 100GB Agency, unlimited Enterprise) or connect your own accounts. All cloud backups are encrypted with AES-256 for security."
      },
      {
        question: "What is one-click staging and why do I need it?",
        answer: "One-click staging creates a complete copy of your site where you can safely test updates, new plugins, or design changes without affecting your live site. Test WordPress updates, try new themes, or experiment with plugins risk-free. When everything works perfectly, push changes to production with confidence."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I restore specific files or just the whole site?",
        answer: "Pro+ plans include granular restore - you can restore specific files, individual database tables, selective plugins, or point-in-time recovery. No need to restore the entire site if you just need one file. Free version restores the complete backup only."
      },
      {
        question: "How does disaster recovery work?",
        answer: "Agency+ includes one-click emergency restore with automated failover and backup site activation. If your site goes down, we can activate a backup site in under 5 minutes (RTO < 5 min) with DNS failover support. Enterprise gets real-time replication for zero data loss and instant recovery."
      },
      {
        question: "Can agencies white-label this?",
        answer: "Yes! Agency and Enterprise plans include complete white-label options: remove our branding, use your own plugin name and logo, create client-facing dashboards, and generate branded reports. Perfect for agencies managing client sites who want to maintain their own brand identity."
      },
      {
        question: "How many sites can I use it on?",
        answer: "Free and Pro: 1 website. Agency: 25 websites with centralized management. Enterprise: unlimited sites. All plans include unlimited backups per site (Free stores 3 locally, Pro+ unlimited with cloud storage)."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it compatible with large sites?",
        answer: "Yes! Our incremental backup technology handles sites of any size efficiently. We've tested with sites over 100GB. Enterprise plan includes dedicated resources, parallel processing, and can handle 10TB+ data with auto-scaling. Large media libraries and databases are no problem."
      },
      {
        question: "Do backups slow down my site?",
        answer: "No! Backups run in the background with minimal impact. Our AI schedules backups during low-traffic periods. Incremental backups are extremely fast since they only save changed files. Enterprise gets dedicated processing resources for zero performance impact."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer refunds?",
        answer: "Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. If you're not completely satisfied for any reason, contact us within 30 days of purchase for a full refund, no questions asked."

        question: "How does the AI optimization work?",
        answer: "Our AI analyzes your database structure, usage patterns, and growth trends to suggest optimal cleanup schedules and retention policies. It identifies performance bottlenecks, predicts growth patterns, and recommends custom strategies tailored to your site. Pro+ plans get real-time AI recommendations, while Enterprise includes predictive maintenance and anomaly detection."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it safe to optimize my database?",
        answer: "Yes! Instant Cache automatically creates a backup before every optimization. You can preview changes in safe mode before applying them. The cleanup rules are conservative by default (keeping last 3 revisions, 30+ day auto-drafts). If anything goes wrong, one-click restore brings back your data instantly."
      },
      {
        question: "Will it slow down my site during optimization?",
        answer: "No! Optimizations run efficiently in the background. Scheduled cleanups can be set for off-peak hours, and the system is resource-aware to avoid impacting site performance. Most optimizations complete in seconds to minutes depending on database size."
      },
      {
        question: "What does database cleanup actually remove?",
        answer: "Free removes: post revisions (keeps last 3), spam/trashed comments, expired transients, orphaned postmeta, and old auto-drafts (30+ days). Pro adds: duplicate postmeta, orphaned term relationships, unused terms, pingbacks/trackbacks, duplicate comments, and expired cron events. All cleanup is safe and reversible with backup restore."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I schedule automatic optimizations?",
        answer: "Yes! Pro and above include scheduled auto-cleanup with daily, weekly, or monthly frequency. You can customize the schedule, set time zones, choose off-peak hours, and receive email reports after each run. The system automatically backs up before cleanup and skips if backup fails."
      },
      {
        question: "What's included in performance monitoring?",
        answer: "Pro+ includes real-time database query performance tracking, slow query detection, table size monitoring, and growth trend analysis. You'll get alerts when your database grows beyond thresholds, slow queries are detected, or table bloat occurs. Enterprise adds predictive analytics and anomaly detection."
      },
      {
        question: "Does it work with WooCommerce and other plugins?",

      {
        question: "How does Instant Cart Recovery differ from other cart recovery plugins?",
        answer: "Unlike basic cart recovery plugins, we offer AI-powered send time optimization (35% better recovery rates), multi-channel recovery (Email + SMS + WhatsApp), exit-intent popups with dynamic discounts, and an AI discount calculator that protects your margins. Our Free version alone is more powerful than most paid competitors with 100 carts/month tracking, recovery dashboard, and achievement system."
      },
      {
        question: "What is AI-powered send time optimization?",
        answer: "Our machine learning analyzes each customer's behavior patterns, timezone, past engagement data, and purchase history to determine the optimal time to send recovery emails. Instead of sending at a fixed time like '1 hour after abandonment,' it might send to one customer at 7pm (when they usually shop) and another at 10am. This personalization increases recovery rates by an average of 35%."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the AI discount calculator work?",
        answer: "The AI analyzes cart value, customer purchase history, product profit margins, and recovery likelihood to suggest the minimum discount needed. For a $200 cart from a returning customer, it might suggest 5%. For a $50 cart from a first-time visitor, it might suggest 15%. This protects your margins while maximizing recovery rates."
      },
      {
        question: "What are SMS recovery rates compared to email?",
        answer: "SMS has a 98% open rate compared to email's 20% open rate, making it 5x more effective. Pro includes 500 SMS credits/month, Agency gets 2,000/month, Enterprise unlimited. Most stores see 40-60% of their recoveries coming from SMS despite it being a secondary channel. Combined Email + SMS sequences recover 15-30% of abandoned carts."
      },
      {
        question: "How do exit-intent popups work?",
        answer: "Pro and above include exit-intent detection that triggers when a customer is about to leave your site with items in cart. A popup appears offering a dynamic discount (5-15% based on cart value) to complete the purchase now. This captures 10-20% of would-be abandoners before they leave. Includes mobile-responsive designs and A/B testing."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I track guest carts (customers not logged in)?",
        answer: "Yes! Pro and above include advanced guest cart tracking using cookie-based technology. We capture cart data when customers add items or reach checkout, even if they don't complete registration. This tracks 60-70% of guest abandoners who would otherwise be lost."
      },
      {
        question: "How many recovery emails can I send?",
        answer: "Free includes 1 automated email. Pro includes multi-step sequences with up to 3 emails (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours, 72 hours after abandonment). Agency and Enterprise have unlimited emails per sequence. All sequences stop automatically when cart is recovered or if customer makes any purchase."
      },
      {
        question: "What email marketing tools integrate?",
        answer: "Pro includes direct integrations with Mailchimp, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign, and ConvertKit. Agency adds HubSpot, Salesforce, and Zoho CRM. Enterprise includes custom API integrations. Sync recovered customers to your email lists, trigger follow-up campaigns, and enrich customer data automatically."
      },
      {
        question: "How does multi-channel recovery work?",
        answer: "Agency and Enterprise orchestrate recovery across Email, SMS, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. You can create sequences like: 1) Email at 1 hour, 2) SMS at 6 hours if email not opened, 3) WhatsApp at 24 hours if SMS not clicked. The system detects preferred channels and optimizes delivery automatically."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I white-label this for my clients?",
        answer: "Yes! Agency and Enterprise include complete white-label options: remove 'Instant Cart Recovery' branding, use custom plugin name and icon, create client-ready admin interface, and generate branded PDF reports. Perfect for agencies managing client WooCommerce stores."
      },
      {
        question: "How many websites can I use this on?",
        answer: "Free and Pro support 1 WooCommerce store. Agency supports up to 25 stores with centralized management. Enterprise supports unlimited stores. All plans include unlimited cart tracking per store (Free limited to 100 carts/month, Pro+ unlimited)."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer a money-back guarantee?",
        answer: "Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. If you're not satisfied for any reason, contact us within 30 days of purchase for a full refund, no questions asked. Most stores see positive ROI within the first week."

        question: "What is gamification and how does it work?",
        answer: "Pro includes interactive elements like spin-to-win wheels, scratch cards, and quiz popups that make lead capture fun and engaging. Users interact with the game to 'win' a discount code or prize. This increases conversion rates by 40-60% because it's entertaining rather than annoying. Fully customizable prizes, probabilities, and coupon generation."
      },
      {
        question: "How do multi-step forms increase conversions?",
        answer: "Multi-step forms break complex forms into smaller, easier steps with visual progress indicators. Research shows they increase conversions by 300% because users are more likely to complete a short first step, then feel committed to finishing. Pro includes unlimited steps with conditional logic and per-step analytics."

        question: "What is cart abandonment prevention?",
