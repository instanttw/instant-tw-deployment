## üîß Technical Issue

### The Problem

There's a **field name mismatch** between the StripeCheckoutButton component and the Stripe API:

**StripeCheckoutButton sends:**
```json
{
  "productId": "hosting-startup",
  "billingCycle": "monthly"
}
```

**But Stripe API expects:**
```json
{
  "plan": "pro",
  "billing": "monthly"
}
```

**Result:** Checkout fails with "Missing required fields: plan and billing"

### Why WP Scan Works

The WP Scan plans page uses a **custom `handleUpgrade()` function** that correctly sends the right field names:

```typescript
fetch('/api/stripe/checkout', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    plan: 'pro',        // ‚úÖ Correct
    billing: 'monthly'  // ‚úÖ Correct
  })
})
```
